# Deep-Steganography

Tensorflow Implementation of [Hiding Images in Plain Sight: Deep Steganography](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6802-hiding-images-in-plain-sight-deep-steganography) (unofficial)

[Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the science of Hiding a message in another message. In this case, a Picture is hidden inside another picture using Deep Learning.



## Dependencies Installation 
The dependencies can be installed by using 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the tensorflow CPU version by default.
If you would like to use your GPU , you can do 
```
pip install --force-reinstall tensorflow-gpu
```
This basically reinstalls the gpu version of tensorflow for your system. 

### Currently a WIP(I only have a measly 1070 and results/benchmarks are taking time :( )
